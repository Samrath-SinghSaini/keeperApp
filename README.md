# Keeper App - A fullstack task management app

## Description
Source code for a Task Management App inspired by Google Keep application, this project allows users to sign up, login and manage their daily tasks by adding and completing tasks and allows the ability to add new lists according to their requirements.
This application is made using NodeJS and Express to implement the backend API, React for the frontend UI and MongoDB and Mongoose for the database. 
### Live Link
Frontend - https://keeper-app-two-eta.vercel.app/
Backend - https://keeperappbackend-ijry.onrender.com 
Note - In case the site takes too long to load, open the backend link, once it is fully loaded, refresh the frontend link and it should be working fine. Not a great User experience but 
that is the tradeoff with free hosting.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You need to have NodeJS and npm installed on your machine to install and run the project locally. 
### Installation
Run the below commands on your terminal
